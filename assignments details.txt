The focus of this assignment is to create a website with a grid based layout that consists of more than one page and make it easy for the user to link to each page. As in the previous task, you need to apply relevant semantic markup to the text as well as creating headings and image descriptions when needed.

In addition to the provided text for the site, you must create one extra page called “My first computer” (or something similar), in which you describe your own personal experience with your very first computer. You will of course have to write the text for this page yourself.
