    <h2>My first computer</h2>
<p>
     had an Intel based CPU, 512mb of ram, 64GB of Hard Disk, was 
actually pretty good for the time and Windows xp.
I think I had 
for a long time the Dial-up connection that made that typical sound upon connecting to internet.
The incredible thing was the monitor, an Olidata, that lasted more than 10 years.
